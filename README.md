### Hi there I'm Tobi ðŸ‘‹

I have studied Psychology and completed a Bachelor- and Master of Science in the field.  
Afterward I worked in the clinical field, but decided to change careers into a more technical direction by working as a project manager in experimental psychophysiology.  
When I first made contact with python and R in the context of machine learning (signal processing) and experimental data, I instantly fell in love with it.  
Therefore, I decided to focus entirely on my technical aspirations by starting a bootcamp to become a full-fledged data-scientist. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently taking part in a full-time 15 week datascience bootcamp at the WBS - Coding School
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, pandas, machine-learning, SQL, A/B-testing, data-visualisation, and many other new things 
- âœ¨ This github will be a collection of my personal datascience and programming projects
